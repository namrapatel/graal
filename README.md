# Graal

A mini-game where players can form Guilds, build Armies, and capture Forts. The goal is to top the Fort holding leaderboard by holding it for the longest period of time.

This version of the game has no resource system, the player simply has infinite resources because there is no need to limit them since no one else is playing at the moment. Simple commands will allow the player to most things in this version of the game, the focus is currently not on the contracts.
